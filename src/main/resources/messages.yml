# -================================-
#    Customisable Player Messages
# -================================-
# All messages use the '&' symbol for the minecraft default colouring/formatting
#
# This document supports hex colour coding. If you want to include a hex colour, insert before the text you want coloured
# e.g. noPermission: "#6e140dYou do not have permission to use that command"
#
# If you want a message to not have the prefix, tag it at the start of the message '[NO_PREFIX]'
# Make sure the tag is the VERY start, no format codes or anything
# e.g. noPermission: "[NO_PREFIX]&cYou do not have permission to use that command"
#
# Messages for each world
# If you want a world to have specific messages, have the world name as the first option, and then follow the format for 'DEFAULT'
# If no list is provided for a world, then messages are retrieved from 'DEFAULT'
# Example
# Spawn:
#   ENTITY:
#     PLAYER:
#       - "Your message here"
#     CREEPER:
#       - "%player% got blown up"
# etc etc
#
# Placeholders - note that not all Placeholders are applicable to all messages
# %player% - the player that died
# %killer% - the entity/player that killed the player
# %item% - hoverable item to view what item killed the player
# %item_name% - name of the item that killed the player
# %fall_height% - height of the fall (in blocks). Only applicable for death type of 'FALL'

# Prefix for all messages - List Messages stored as lists do NOT have the prefix added however
prefix: "&r&7[&6FDM&7]&f"

DEFAULT:
  # Messages when the player dies to these mobs - note that if the list is complete you can easily add the missing mobs (including across updates)
